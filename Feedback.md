NOTE:  The points for the last three rows of the table above are assigned individually and you can see those individual points added to this rubric on Blackboard. Individual scores may vary. The scale factor for individuals is based on my perception of each individual's contribution to the group project. It will also be determined by looking at the quality of the commits and commit messages by each individual in the group.

| 25 pts. Basic I/O | None or possibly one of the two switches or LEDs connected. | Both I/O connected and a satisfactory application program working | Excellent application program works with both switches and LEDs |
| 10 pts. Advanced I/O | No advanced I/O. Or for more points possibly just input or just advanced output and maybe not working correctly | Excellent advanced input or Excellent advanced output. | Excellent input, output and program all working on the board |
| 25 pts. Demonstration Program  | Simulation test bench created but not documented well or does not work properly |	Single ad-hoc test code that tests every possible instruction. |	Both an ad-hoc program AND a more advanced program that runs correctly. |
| 25 pts. Mini Presentation | Little to no content, poor presentation. | Several of the required elements for Exercise 4 | All the required elements of Exercise 4 and a good presentation.
| 15 pts. Individual Reflection | Little to no reflection no grades assigned. | Some of the required elements of the reflection. Some evaluation of the group. | All the required elements of Exercise 4 and a good presentation and a good evaluation of group members.
